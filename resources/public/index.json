AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply deploy your code, define an event trigger, and Lambda automatically handles execution, scaling, and billing based on actual usage time.\nKey Benefits of AWS Lambda: No server management: No need to maintain or patch servers. Automatic scaling: Lambda scales automatically in response to incoming requests. Pay-per-use pricing: You pay only for the compute time you consume, measured in milliseconds. Easy integration: Works seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, etc. When should you use Lambda? Use Case Why Lambda is a good fit Processing events from S3 Automatically handle files uploaded (e.g., image resizing) Building lightweight APIs Combine with API Gateway to build REST APIs without servers Scheduled executions (cron) Use with EventBridge for periodic tasks Stream/log analysis Process data from Kinesis or DynamoDB Streams Initial Requirements: An AWS account (registered and verified) Access to AWS Management Console IAM permissions to create Lambda functions and roles if needed Next, weâ€™ll walk through creating your first Lambda function in the next lab.\n"

	"content": "Introduction to AWS Lambda Overview In this lab, you will learn about AWS Lambda, one of the most powerful and widely-used serverless services in the AWS ecosystem. You will understand what Lambda is, when to use it, how it gets triggered, and how its pricing model works. This foundational knowledge will prepare you to build and deploy serverless applications effectively.\nWhat is AWS Lambda? AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services. With Lambda, you can write your code and deploy it without worrying about provisioning or managing servers. AWS automatically handles:\nCompute resource provisioning Operating system and security patches Auto-scaling based on usage Monitoring and logging Lambda is ideal for executing small, stateless units of code in response to events.\nLambda is event-driven, which means your code only runs when triggered by a specific event.\nWhen Should You Use Lambda? Use AWS Lambda in the following scenarios:\nUse Case Why Lambda is a Good Fit Process images after S3 upload Trigger automatically from S3 events Send notifications/emails Combine with SNS, SES, or EventBridge Backend for REST APIs Integrates seamlessly with API Gateway Scheduled tasks / cron jobs Trigger using EventBridge or CloudWatch Events Event-based messaging Triggered by SQS, SNS, DynamoDB Streams, etc. How Does Lambda Get Triggered? A Lambda function only runs when a trigger event occurs. These triggers come from other AWS services or external sources.\nðŸ”„ Common trigger sources include: Amazon S3 â€“ on object upload/delete events API Gateway â€“ on HTTP/REST API requests DynamoDB Streams â€“ on table insert/update/delete CloudWatch Events/EventBridge â€“ on scheduled rules SNS/SQS â€“ on message received Triggers allow you to build automated and reactive systems without maintaining background workers or polling logic.\nHow is Lambda Priced? Lambda pricing is based on two primary factors:\nNumber of invocations (how many times the function is called) Compute usage, which includes memory size and execution duration ðŸŽ¯ Pricing formula: Cost = (execution time in milliseconds) Ã— (allocated memory) Ã— (number of requests) "

Finally, click on Create Group.\nThe creation of the admin group is complete.\nCreate Admin User You can use the AWS Management Console to create IAM users.\nFollow the sign-in procedure appropriate to your user type as described in the topic How to sign in to AWS in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.\nOn the Console Home page, select the IAM service.\nIn the navigation pane, select Users, and then select Add users.\nOn the Specify user details page, under User details, enter the new user\u0026rsquo;s name in the User name field. This will be their sign-in name for AWS.\nNote: User names can be up to 64 letters, digits, and certain characters: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at sign (@), underscore (_), and hyphen (-). User names must be unique within an account, and they are case-sensitive when used in policies or ARNs. However, they are case-insensitive during the sign-in process.\nSelect Provide user access to the AWS Management Console. This generates AWS Management Console sign-in credentials for the new user.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be asked whether you\u0026rsquo;re providing console access to a person. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to create users in IAM Identity Center rather than IAM. To switch to creating the user in IAM Identity Center, select Specify a user in Identity Center.\nIf IAM Identity Center is not enabled, this option takes you to the service page in the console to enable it. If IAM Identity Center is enabled, this option takes you to the Specify user details page in IAM Identity Center. If you cannot use IAM Identity Center, select I want to create an IAM user and continue following this procedure.\nFor Console password, choose one of the following:\nAutogenerated password: The user gets a randomly generated password that adheres to the account password policy. You can view or download the password on the Retrieve password page. Custom password: Assign a password that you enter in the box. Optionally, select Users must create a new password at next sign-in (recommended) to ensure the user changes their password the first time they sign in.\nSelect Next.\nOn the Set permissions page, choose how to assign permissions for this user:\nAdd user to group: Assign the user to one or more groups with existing permissions policies. Copy permissions: Copy permissions from an existing user with similar needs. Attach policies directly: Attach AWS managed or custom policies directly to the user. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended to attach policies to groups whenever possible.\nOptionally, set a permissions boundary in the Permissions boundary section. This is an advanced feature that controls maximum permissions.\nSelect Next.\nOptionally, on the Review and create page, under Tags, you can attach metadata to the user using key-value pairs.\nReview your choices, and when ready, select Create user.\nOn the Retrieve password page, get the password assigned to the user:\nSelect Show next to the password to view it manually.\nSelect Download .csv to save the user\u0026rsquo;s sign-in credentials as a .csv file.\nSelect Email sign-in instructions to customize and send an email to the user.

Keep the file in a secure location.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;Done.\u0026rdquo; When you no longer need the access key, we recommend either deleting it or at least considering disabling it to prevent misuse.\nNote: These steps apply only to the root user account on AWS. For IAM users or roles, the process of creating and managing access keys may differ.\nRevoking Access Key for Root User on AWS Minimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM (Identity and Access Management) permissions:\nYou must be logged in as the root user of your AWS account, this does not require any additional AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. You cannot perform these steps as an IAM user or a role. Use the email address and password of your AWS account to sign in to the AWS Management Console as the root user. In the top-right corner of the console, select your account name or number, then choose Security Credentials. Under Access keys, select the access key you wish to delete, then in the Actions section, choose Delete. Note Alternatively, you can choose to Deactivate an access key instead of permanently deleting it. This allows you to continue using it in the future without changing both the key ID and secret key. While the key is deactivated, any requests using it in AWS API requests will fail with an \u0026ldquo;access denied\u0026rdquo; error.\nIn the Delete dialog, select Deactivate, enter the access key ID to confirm your intention to delete it, then choose Delete.\n"
