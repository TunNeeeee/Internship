## Introduction to AWS Lambda

**Note:** Before starting, ensure that you have an AWS account and access to the AWS Management Console.

## What is AWS Lambda?

**AWS Lambda** is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply deploy your code, define an event trigger, and Lambda automatically handles execution, scaling, and billing based on actual usage time.

## Key Benefits of AWS Lambda:

1. **No server management:** No need to maintain or patch servers.
2. **Automatic scaling:** Lambda scales automatically in response to incoming requests.
3. **Pay-per-use pricing:** You pay only for the compute time you consume, measured in milliseconds.
4. **Easy integration:** Works seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, etc.

## When should you use Lambda?

| Use Case                    | Why Lambda is a good fit                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processing events from S3   | Automatically handle files uploaded (e.g., image resizing)  |
| Building lightweight APIs   | Combine with API Gateway to build REST APIs without servers |
| Scheduled executions (cron) | Use with EventBridge for periodic tasks                     |
| Stream/log analysis         | Process data from Kinesis or DynamoDB Streams               |

## Initial Requirements:

* An AWS account (registered and verified)
* Access to AWS Management Console
* IAM permissions to create Lambda functions and roles if needed

Next, weâ€™ll walk through creating your first Lambda function in the next lab.
