## Overview

Effective security monitoring and incident response are crucial components in securing containerized environments. This section focuses on how to **log activities**, **monitor security metrics**, and **conduct penetration testing** to enhance runtime security visibility and readiness for real-world attacks.

You will learn to:

- Collect and analyze logs from your workloads using **CloudWatch Logging**.
- Build a **Security Dashboard** to track real-time metrics and threat indicators.
- Simulate attacks through **Penetration Testing** to evaluate your defense mechanisms.
