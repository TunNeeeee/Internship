## Step 1: Install tools on Windows

1. **AWS CLI**
   Visit: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html) ‚Üí Download the `.msi` file and install it like any regular software. Then open **CMD** and verify:
   ```powershell
   aws --version
   ```
   If the version appears, the installation was successful.

   ‚öôÔ∏è Configure AWS account:
   - Create IAM USER
   - Create Access keys/Secret Access Key
   - Open PowerShell
   ```powershell
   aws configure
   ```
   - Then enter the following information:
     - AWS Access Key ID
     - AWS Secret Access Key
     - Region: ap-southeast-1
     - Output format: json

2. **Install kubectl**
   Visit the official link: üëâ https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
   Or use choco if you have Chocolatey installed:
   ```powershell
   choco install kubernetes-cli
   ```
   Verify the installation:
   ```powershell
   kubectl version --client
   ```

3. **Install eksctl**
   Visit: üëâ https://eksctl.io/introduction/#installation
   Download the .exe file ‚Üí Rename it to eksctl.exe and:
   - Copy to a directory like C:\Program Files\eksctl
   - Add that directory to Environment Variables > PATH

   Or use choco if you have Chocolatey installed:
   ```powershell
   choco install eksctl
   ```
   - Verify the installation:
   ```powershell
   eksctl version
   ```

## Step 2: Create cluster configuration file

Open Notepad or VS Code, create a file named eks-cluster.yaml with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: secure-eks
  region: ap-southeast-1

nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-1
    instanceType: t3.medium
    desiredCapacity: 2
    ssh:
      allow: true
```

Save it in the same directory where you'll open the terminal later.

## Step 3: Create cluster using command

Open PowerShell or terminal in VS Code, navigate to the directory containing the eks-cluster.yaml file, then run:

```bash
eksctl create cluster -f eks-cluster.yaml
```

You might encounter this error: Error: cannot find EC2 key pair "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

üí° Cause: In the eks-cluster.yaml configuration file, you have enabled SSH for the node group:

```yaml
ssh:
  allow: true
```

When allow: true, eksctl will try to find the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to use as the SSH key pair ‚Äì but you haven't created this key on your Windows machine yet.

You need to manually create the SSH key pair. Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
ssh-keygen
```

Press Enter repeatedly to accept the default path (C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_rsa)

Then verify the file:

```powershell
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
```

Run the cluster creation command again:

```bash
eksctl create cluster -f eks-cluster.yaml
```

üìå eksctl will automatically use the id_rsa.pub file and create the corresponding key pair in AWS EC2.

‚è≥ The creation process may take 10‚Äì15 minutes. eksctl will create: VPC, IAM role, Security Group, Control Plane, EC2 Nodes...

## Step 4: Verify connection with kubectl

After the cluster is created, verify the connection:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

‚úÖ You should see 2 worker nodes running ‚Äì EKS is ready to use!

üì∏ Take a screenshot of the terminal results to use in your workshop report.

## Notes and Important Points

- eksctl will automatically create VPC and node groups if they don't exist
- It's recommended to use region ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) if you're in Vietnam to reduce latency
- The cluster creation process is fully automated through eksctl
- Make sure your AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to create EKS resources
- Keep your SSH keys secure as they provide access to your worker nodes
