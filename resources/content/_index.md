title: "Container Security Hardening and Runtime Protection"
weight: 3
---

## 🔐 Introduction

In this section, you will learn how to **harden your container environment** to minimize security risks and apply **runtime monitoring and protection techniques** to detect and respond to abnormal behaviors in real time.

Even when your application is up and running, containers can still be targeted if proper protection layers are not in place. Therefore, combining **proactive measures (hardening)** with **reactive techniques (runtime detection)** is critically important.

---

## 🧩 What You Will Learn

- Best practices for hardening containers and Kubernetes Pods (user, capabilities, readonlyRootFilesystem, seccomp, apparmor, etc.)
- Using tools like **Trivy** to scan for vulnerabilities before deployment  
- Installing and configuring **Falco** to detect suspicious activity in containers  
- Simulating and analyzing real-time attack scenarios  
- Applying runtime security policies to minimize exploitation risks  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this section, you will:

- Understand how to apply security best practices for containers/Pods  
- Learn the role of monitoring tools like Falco  
- Be able to deploy a runtime protection system in a real-world environment  
- Identify suspicious behaviors early and respond appropriately
